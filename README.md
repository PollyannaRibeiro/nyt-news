### AJAX

This is an asynchronous request App made using AJAX with fetch. 
The two APIs used are:
* The NY Times - where I got the articles
*  Unsplash - to get the pictures.

## The Project

Before informing what the users are interested today, they can see the most recent articles of the NY Times. After submitting a request, they can see if it returns some picture and articles about the subject that they are interested in.

I did not use any different style from the offered by Udacity, so this project was only to evaluate my skills working on JS, HTML and CSS, and not my design skills. It's also a responsive app, I used Bootstrap cards to create responsive style.

#  The Challenge

Works with promises was a big challenge for me. It was like discovering a new world of possibilities that I've never worked before.

## To open:
